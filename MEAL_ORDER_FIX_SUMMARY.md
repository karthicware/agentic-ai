# Meal Order Flow Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The meal order flow was failing because the `main_multi_tool_agent` was trying to call `flight_info_agent` and `meal_order_info_agent` as sub-agents, but it didn't have access to their tools directly.

## Root Cause
- The `main_multi_tool_agent` was configured with sub-agents but without the necessary tools
- The agent instructions were telling it to call other agents instead of using its own tools
- This created a circular dependency where agents were trying to call each other

## Fix Applied

### 1. **Updated Agent Builder** (`app/agent_builder.py`)
```python
# BEFORE:
main_multi_tool_agent = Agent(
    model=MODAL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH,
    name="main_multi_tool_agent",
    instruction=get_agent_instructions("main_multi_tool_agent"),
    description="Handles catering modules",
    sub_agents=[flight_info_agent, meal_order_agent, meal_issue_agent, stock_count_approver_agent, knowledge_agent]
)

# AFTER:
main_multi_tool_agent = Agent(
    model=MODAL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH,
    name="main_multi_tool_agent",
    instruction=get_agent_instructions("main_multi_tool_agent"),
    description="Handles catering modules",
    tools=[flight_module.get_flight_details, meal_order_module.get_meal_order_details],
    sub_agents=[flight_info_agent, meal_order_agent, meal_support_agent, stock_count_approver_agent, knowledge_agent]
)
```

### 2. **Updated Agent Instructions** (`app/agent_instructions.py`)
- Added explicit tool definitions for `get_flight_details` and `get_meal_order_details`
- Updated operational flow to use tools directly instead of calling sub-agents
- Added clear meal order response format

### 3. **Fixed Meal Issue Agent**
- Added proper tools to `meal_support_agent`
- Updated instructions to use its own tools instead of calling other agents

## Expected Behavior Now

When you ask: **"What is the meal order for the flight EK0203 20-Jan-2024"**

The system should:

1. **Root Agent** → Delegates to `main_multi_tool_agent`
2. **Main Multi Tool Agent** → Uses `get_flight_details` tool with flightNo="EK0203", flightDate="20-Jan-2024"
3. **Extract mflId** → Gets mflId=2 from flight response
4. **Get Meal Orders** → Uses `get_meal_order_details` tool with mflId=2
5. **Present Results** → Shows meal order details in tabular format

## Test Results
✅ **Agent Structure**: Main agent has both flight and meal order tools
✅ **Flight Module**: Successfully retrieves flight details (mflId: 2)
✅ **Meal Order Module**: Successfully retrieves meal order details

## Expected Response Format
```
**Meal Order Details for Flight EK0203 (20-Jan-2024)**

| Meal Type | Quantity | Special Requests | Status |
|-----------|----------|------------------|--------|
| First Class | 2        | None             | Confirmed |
| Business Class | 20      | None             | Confirmed |
| Premium Economy | 0       | None             | Confirmed |
| Economy Class | 55       | None             | Confirmed |
```

## Key Improvements
1. **No More Circular Dependencies**: Agents use their own tools instead of calling each other
2. **Clear Tool Assignment**: Each agent has the tools it needs
3. **Proper Delegation**: Root agent properly delegates to main agent
4. **Seamless User Experience**: No exposure of internal agent transfers

The meal order flow should now work correctly without asking for information that was already provided!
