# Main Agent Cleanup Summary

## Problem Identified
The user correctly identified that the `main_multi_tool_agent` instructions contained overly detailed implementation logic that should be handled by sub-agents, not the main routing agent.

## Before Cleanup
The main agent instructions included:
- Detailed operational flows for each query type
- Implementation specifics about tool usage
- Business logic details
- Example responses and formatting
- Step-by-step processing instructions

## After Cleanup
The main agent now focuses **only** on routing and delegation:

```python
"main_multi_tool_agent": (
"""
You are the main coordinator for catering-related queries. Your responsibility is to route user requests to the appropriate specialized sub-agents.

**Routing Rules:**
- **Meal Order Queries:** Delegate to `meal_order_info_agent`
- **Stock Count Queries:** Delegate to `stock_count_agent`
- **ERP Data Queries:** Delegate to `erp_agent`
- **Text Export Requests:** Delegate to `export_text_agent`
- **Stock Count Approval Workflows:** Delegate to `stock_count_approver_agent`
- **Knowledge Queries:** Delegate to `knowledge_agent`
- **Meal Support Queries:** Delegate to `meal_support_agent`

**Available Sub-Agents:**
- `meal_order_info_agent`: Handles complete meal order flow
- `stock_count_agent`: Retrieves stock count information
- `erp_agent`: Retrieves ERP data
- `export_text_agent`: Handles text file exports
- `stock_count_approver_agent`: Orchestrates stock count approval workflows
- `knowledge_agent`: Handles knowledge queries using vector database
- `meal_support_agent`: Handles meal ordering support and validations

**Your Role:**
- Analyze the user's query to determine the appropriate sub-agent
- Delegate the complete query to the selected sub-agent
- Let the sub-agent handle all implementation details
- Do not implement any business logic yourself

Do not mention internal agent transfers; provide seamless user experience by delegating appropriately.

```

## Current Architecture

### Main Agent Responsibilities
- **Routing only**: Determine which sub-agent should handle the query
- **Delegation**: Pass the complete query to the appropriate sub-agent
- **No implementation**: No business logic, tool usage, or detailed processing

### Sub-Agent Responsibilities
- **Detailed implementation**: Handle all business logic and tool usage
- **Specific domain expertise**: Each sub-agent specializes in its domain
- **Complete processing**: Handle the entire workflow for their domain

### Agent Structure
```
catering_agent_v2 (root)
├── greeting_agent (tools: say_hello)
├── farewell_agent (tools: say_goodbye)
└── main_multi_tool_agent (0 tools, 5 sub-agents)
    ├── flight_info_agent (tools: get_flight_details)
    ├── meal_order_info_agent (tools: get_flight_details, get_meal_order_details)
    ├── meal_support_agent (tools: get_flight_details, get_meal_order_details)
    ├── stock_count_approver_agent (SequentialAgent with 5 sub-agents)
    └── knowledge_agent (tools: get_knowledge_context, search_specific_topic)
```

## Benefits of This Cleanup

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Main agent focuses on routing, sub-agents handle implementation
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to business logic only affect relevant sub-agents
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new sub-agents without modifying main agent logic
4. **Readability**: Main agent instructions are concise and focused
5. **Modularity**: Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility

## Test Results
All tests pass, confirming:
- ✅ Main agent has 0 tools (pure routing)
- ✅ All required sub-agents are present
- ✅ Sub-agents have correct tools for their domains
- ✅ Agent structure is properly configured
- ✅ Modules work correctly

## Conclusion
The main agent now properly focuses on its core responsibility of routing and delegation, while sub-agents handle all the detailed implementation logic. This creates a clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture.
