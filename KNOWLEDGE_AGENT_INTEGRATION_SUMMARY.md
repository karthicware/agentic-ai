# Knowledge Agent Integration Summary

## Problem Identified
When users ask for more details, explanation, or analysis after receiving meal order results, the system was not automatically connecting to the knowledge agent for comprehensive information.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated Agent Routing Rules**

#### Root Agent (`catering_agent_v2`)
```python
**Delegation Rules:**
- For greetings (hi, hello, etc.): Delegate to 'greeting_agent'
- For farewells (bye, goodbye, see you, etc.): Delegate to 'farewell_agent'
- For ALL other queries (flight info, meal orders, stock count, ERP, exports, knowledge, follow-up questions): Delegate to 'main_multi_tool_agent'
```

#### Main Agent (`main_multi_tool_agent`)
```python
**Routing Rules:**
- **Meal Order Queries:** Delegate to `meal_order_info_agent`
- **Follow-up Questions (more details, explanation, analysis):** Delegate to `knowledge_agent`
- **Stock Count Queries:** Delegate to `stock_count_agent`
- **ERP Data Queries:** Delegate to `erp_agent`
- **Text Export Requests:** Delegate to `export_text_agent`
- **Stock Count Approval Workflows:** Delegate to `stock_count_approver_agent`
- **Knowledge Queries:** Delegate to `knowledge_agent`
```

### 2. **Enhanced Meal Order Agent Instructions**

The `meal_order_info_agent` now includes:
```python
**Important Notes:**
- When users ask for more details, explanation, or analysis, delegate to the knowledge agent for comprehensive information

Remember: When users request more details or explanations, connect them to the knowledge agent for comprehensive analysis.
```

## Current Flow for Follow-up Questions

### Scenario: User asks for more details after meal order query

```
User: "show me meal order EK0203 20-Jun-2025"
→ meal_order_info_agent (provides basic meal order info)

User: "why" or "need detailed information" or "explain more"
→ main_multi_tool_agent (recognizes follow-up question)
→ knowledge_agent (provides comprehensive analysis)
→ Returns: Detailed explanation with knowledge base information
```

### Scenario: Direct knowledge query

```
User: "What are the procedures for meal ordering?"
→ main_multi_tool_agent (recognizes knowledge query)
→ knowledge_agent (searches vector database)
→ Returns: Comprehensive procedures and guidelines
```

## Knowledge Agent Capabilities

### **Available Tools:**
1. **`get_knowledge_context`**: Searches vector database with complex query decomposition
2. **`search_specific_topic`**: Searches for specific topics with configurable results

### **Features:**
- **Complex Query Decomposition**: Breaks down complex queries into simpler ones
- **Context Integration**: Considers previous conversation context
- **Advanced Reranking**: Ensures most relevant information is presented first
- **Source Attribution**: References information sources when possible
- **Cross-Reference**: Connects information from different sources

### **Response Format:**
```
**Knowledge Search Results:**
- **Query Processed:** [Original user query]
- **Decomposed Queries:** [List of decomposed queries if applicable]
- **Documents Found:** [Number of relevant documents]
- **Search Results:** [Comprehensive answer based on retrieved information]
```

## Example Interactions

### **Initial Query:**
```
User: "show me meal order EK0203 20-Jun-2025"

Response:
Flight Information:
- Flight Number: EK0203
- Flight Date: 20-Jun-2025
- Service Type: P
- Flight Status: PD

Meal Order Eligibility:
- INELIGIBLE - We regret to inform you that meal services are only available for passenger flights (service type J)...

Meal Order Details:
No meal order details found for this flight.
```

### **Follow-up Question:**
```
User: "why" or "need detailed information"

Response:
**Knowledge Search Results:**
- **Query Processed:** Why are meal services not available for flight EK0203?
- **Documents Found:** 3
- **Search Results:** 
  Based on our catering policies and procedures, meal services are only available for passenger flights (service type J). 
  Cargo flights (service type P) do not have meal ordering facilities because they don't carry passengers. 
  The flight EK0203 on 20-Jun-2025 is a cargo flight, which explains why meal orders are not available...
```

## Benefits of This Integration

1. **Seamless User Experience**: Users can ask follow-up questions naturally
2. **Comprehensive Information**: Knowledge agent provides detailed explanations
3. **Context Awareness**: System considers previous conversation context
4. **Professional Responses**: Well-structured, informative answers
5. **Automatic Routing**: System intelligently routes queries to appropriate agents

## Testing Recommendations

### **Test Follow-up Questions:**
```bash
# Test 1: Basic meal order query
User: "show me meal order EK0203 20-Jun-2025"

# Test 2: Follow-up for more details
User: "why" or "explain more" or "need detailed information"

# Expected: Should route to knowledge agent and provide comprehensive explanation
```

### **Test Direct Knowledge Queries:**
```bash
# Test 1: General knowledge query
User: "What are the procedures for meal ordering?"

# Test 2: Specific topic query
User: "Tell me about flight service types and meal eligibility"

# Expected: Should route directly to knowledge agent
```

## Conclusion

The system now provides a complete user experience:
- ✅ **Initial Queries**: Get basic meal order information
- ✅ **Follow-up Questions**: Receive comprehensive explanations via knowledge agent
- ✅ **Direct Knowledge Queries**: Access detailed procedures and policies
- ✅ **Seamless Integration**: No exposure of internal agent transfers

Users can now ask for more details and receive comprehensive, well-structured explanations based on the knowledge base.
